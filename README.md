# Hi there! This is Mariana and i want to share with you mi first comp115 artistic project. 

#  My drawing is a beautiful dreamcatcher, It is not a conventional dreamcatcher, I added my style and perspective to it. I hope you like it. 


## Project Overview: This project is a generative piece of art created with the python3 turtle and random functions. It combines colors and geometrical shapes to form a bautiful dreamcatcher and a beautiful night background. 

## ✨ Features
The drawing is broken down into: 

# Starry Background (`draw_stars`):Uses the `random` module to scatter 300 white dots of varying sizes (Simulates a night sky).
  
# Central Mandala (`draw_circles`): A geometric loop that draws 36 overlapping circles with a variety of 4 colors to create a web.
  
# Feathers (`draw_feathers`): An algorithm that draws three feathers. 

# Sun (`draw_sun`): 12-pointed triangles aligned in a circular shape created by turning angles that simulate a sun

# Decorative Beads (`draw_beads`): Teal beads placed at the junction of the feathers.

# Bound Ring (`draw_outer_circle`): A bold outer circle that ties the mandala elements together.
